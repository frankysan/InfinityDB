# Phased validation queue

**Project domain:** Project infrastructure

This file is the single active register for validation work deferred under the
[phased development workflow](testing.md#phased-development-and-validation).
It tracks **test design and execution obligations**, not implementation features,
release scope, or source ambiguities. `docs/TODO.md` owns implementation work
and defects; `docs/releasing.md` owns mandatory release acceptance. Keep stable
IDs here and link the owning task instead of duplicating its description.

## Queue rules

- Separate the four activities: **essential test creation** and
  **essential targeted execution** happen within the implementation pass;
  **additional test design** is deferred as VD; **broader test execution**
  is deferred as VR. A design pass may run newly written tests for sanity
  without turning into a general execution pass. See
  [testing.md](testing.md#phased-development-and-validation).
- Before ending an implementation pass, record every concrete missing
  regression **design** as VD and each change's deferred broader **execution**
  as VR, including changes needing only an existing full-suite or browser run.
  Record exact immediate test selectors and results separately. Never call an
  unrun check passed or defer a required safety, migration or publication gate.
- Design items are `VD-0001`, `VD-0002`, etc. Each ID is one independently
  actionable test requirement, not one test function or a speculative idea.
  Count open `needs-design` IDs toward the **5-requirement design threshold**.
- Execution items are `VR-0001`, `VR-0002`, etc. Each item represents one
  distinct implementation change awaiting deferred verification, including
  changes whose required test design is unfinished. Count distinct open
  implementation changes, not files, tests, commits, or repeated runs, toward
  the **5-change execution threshold**. Combine multiple checks for the same
  change under one VR item. Link any blocking VD IDs.
- When design reaches 5, the next pass handles test design only. When execution
  reaches 5, the next pass handles test execution only, after required test
  design is ready. If both thresholds are reached, design goes first wherever
  it blocks execution. Do not start another ordinary implementation pass until
  the due pass is addressed. A critical gate or an overdue item takes priority.
- **Maximum age:** process any open deferrable item within 7 calendar days of
  its recorded date, even below threshold. Also process it before the relevant
  release, merge, deployment, or other mandatory acceptance gate. Reassess the
  counts and oldest dates at the beginning and end of every agent pass.
- Never queue work that is required immediately for correctness or risk control.
  [Immediate checks and exceptions](testing.md#phased-development-and-validation)
  still apply, and required hosted CI remains unchanged.
- When design discovers a product defect, add/link the implementation fix in
  `docs/TODO.md` and mark the affected entry `blocked`; do not fix unrelated
  behavior during a dedicated design/execution pass. Failed executions stay
  open until the relevant checks pass on a corrected state.
- Include sufficient version/commit or artifact identity for results to be
  reproducible. A green result from an older state cannot verify a later edit.
  Store bulky reports under ignored `local/`; retain concise durable acceptance
  evidence in its canonical document when required.
- **Retire completed entries immediately after processing:** remove a VD item
  once its tests are designed and the direct sanity checks pass; carry any
  relevant selector/dependency into its open VR item. Remove a VR item when
  its required execution has passed on the intended state and the outcome is
  recorded. Keep failed, blocked, or unrun work open; independent hosted CI
  and release gates are not implicitly accepted.
- This is an **active queue, not a completion log**. Git history retains
  retired detail; do not copy finished items into another running diary.
  Advance the next-unused-ID counters on creation and never reuse an ID.

## Pending test design

Only open VD requirements belong here. **No pending entries.**

A VD entry records its ID/date/status (`needs-design` or `blocked`),
owning TODO work and revision, concrete missing assertion/edge case,
existing coverage, risk, linked VR ID, and test selector/sanity-check
outcome as it is processed. Retire the entry once designed and checked;
retain required dependencies in any still-open VR item.

## Pending deferred execution

Only open VR obligations belong here. **No pending entries.**

A VR entry records its ID/date/status (`awaiting-design`,
`ready-to-run` or `blocked`), the implementation revision/artifact,
immediate focused checks and results, any required VD dependencies,
deferred test selectors/gates, and the final execution outcome.
Retire it once required checks pass on the intended state and the outcome
is recorded. Failed or incomplete verification remains open.

## Next unused IDs

- Design: `VD-0007` (through `VD-0006` retired).
- Execution: `VR-0007` (through `VR-0006` retired).

Increment the relevant next-unused ID when adding a task, even if that
task is later removed. Previous completed records remain in Git history.
The 2026-11-01 cumulative local suite evidence is summarized in
[testing.md](testing.md#chromium-concurrency-under-pytest-xdist);
mandatory CI and final release acceptance remain separate.

## Recording template

Copy only the applicable entry to the corresponding active section and
replace the sample ID with the next unused ID shown above. Do not create
entries for work fully verified during implementation.

```text
- [ ] VD-NNNN (YYYY-MM-DD; needs-design): <required assertion/edge case>.
  Work: <TODO anchor>; change: <revision/files>; risk: <level>.
  Existing coverage: <selector or none>; linked execution: VR-NNNN.
  Outcome: <selector and design-sanity result, when performed>.

- [ ] VR-NNNN (YYYY-MM-DD; awaiting-design): <one implementation change>.
  Work: <TODO anchor>; revision: <commit/artifact>; risk: <level>.
  Immediate: <essential regression selector/result and required validators>.
  Design: VD-NNNN or none.
  Deferred: <existing module/full-suite/integration/manual checks>.
  Outcome: <tested revision, command, counts and evidence, when run>.
```
